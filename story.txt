	Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him the most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang, and although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world. 

        One day, our nation was attacked. My brother and I were having dinner at that moment. The attack was there suddenly, our army was not ready. A lot of civilians got killed by enemy troop. I was in trouble as well and Aang showed up to save me using his airbending skills.
