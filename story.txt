	Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him the most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang, and although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world. 

        One day, our nation was attacked. My brother and I were having dinner at that moment. The attack was there suddenly, our army was not ready. A lot of civilians got killed by enemy troop. I was in trouble as well and Aang showed up to save me using his airbending skills. 

Aang generated an expansive gust of wind which extinguished the many flames that ravaged our nation. I remember looking into his eyes as he walked from the crumbling alley, and to our disbelief, he was unscaved. After he fought back the remaining fire nation troops in our nation, he stayed to help rebuild the many damages done.

Aang uses his powerful magic to gather stones, forming a huge and long wall around our nation. Then he waved his hand, getting a river outside the wall. After a whole afternoon rebuilding process, Aang smiled to me and said, "Long time no see, how are you?"
